# 👋 Hallo.
<strong>Creating things since 2015.</strong>
<br>
I started with Minecraft servers and applications in VB.Net on 2015, I also tried creating Minecraft Plugins and other stuff. 💾

Nowadays I'm focusing on game development, working on an old project. (nothing too serious, I'm just remaking a game that I made in 2018) 🐧

I intend to continue in this area and launch commercial games in the future (with a focus on the mobile market, and maybe on Steam) 🎮

As you can see, my English is not the best, but I'm trying to improve it too! 🪄
