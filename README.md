# 👋 Hallo.
<strong>Creating things since 2015.</strong>
<br>
I started with Minecraft servers and applications in VB.Net on 2015, I also tried creating Minecraft Plugins and other stuff. 💾

Nowadays I'm focused on game development, but I still do other things sometimes. Working on playlotus.net (site under development)

I intend to continue in this area and launch commercial games in the future (with a focus on the mobile market, and maybe on Steam) 🎮
